README File for Galaxy Glider 

My project is a visualization of the redshifting in the universe from 5.1 billion years to 13.8 billion years, the present age of the universe. The main program can be run by executing the python file name with ppython "Panda3dDemoV18.py"

The program uses Panda3D, so the computer will need to have that installed. In addition, the modules, math, sys, and random are needed. 

In Panda3D, I used several 3D models I generated through the use of python scripting in the application Blender. These scripts can be run by opening the files "glaxy.blend", "plane.blend", "treeMakerwithRandom.blend", and "treeMakerTwowithRandom.blend", and clicking the 'run script' option.
